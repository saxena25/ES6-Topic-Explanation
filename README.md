# ES6-Topic-Explanation

1. Let and Const:-
   -let and const are block scoped variables introduced in Es6.
   -let allows you to declare variables that can be reassigned wihtin the block scope.
   -const allows you to declare varibales whose value cannot be reassigned once set.

2. Arrow Function:-
  -Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions in javascript.
  -they have a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expression.
  -Arrow functions do not have thier own 'this' keyword. Instead, they inherit the 'this' value
   from the enclosing lexing content.

3. Template Literals:-
  -Template literals are a way to create strings in JS.
  -they allows you to embed expressions within backticks ` using `${}` syntax.

4. For of loop:-
  -The for...of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.
  -It provides a cleaner syntax compared to traditional for loops.

5. Object and Array destructuring:-
  -Destructuring allows you to extract values from objects and arrays into variables, introduced in ES6.
  -Object destructuring lets you extract properties from objects into variables with the same name as the property.
  -Array destructuring lets you extract elements from arrays into variables based on their position.

6.Spread operator:-
  -The spread operator (...) allows an iterable (e.g., an array or string) to be expanded into individual elements,      introduced in ES6.
  -It can be used in function calls, array literals, object literals, etc., to spread elements or properties
